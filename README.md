# Project Numero 2 - Homelessness vs Unemployment

**Team Members:

**Background: 
Homelessness is observed in every state in the US. Individuals are often found at risk of losing their homes due to various factors. Even in high income states whose salaries and wages are slightly higher than the average, homlessness is seen at alarming levels. Experts and researchers attribute this to many factors such as wages and salaries, lack of affordable housing, unemployment, taxes etc.  

**Data Analyst Objective: 
Extraction of data,Tranforming of data,and Loading of data into a database(ETL) will be utilized to compare homelessness with unemployment within the year of 2020.  We are looking to examine key contributors to homelessness in major states with the end goal to perform ETL using unemployment rate, homeless population, homeless population age, and homeless population gender.


**Research Questions to Answer:
●Is there a correlation between the rise in homelessness and the rise in unemployment rate in major states? 
●Is there a correlation between low wages and homelessness rates?○Relationship between affected demographics (age, race/ethnicity, etc.) and homelessness in these regions
●Are certain states experiencing a stronger correlation than other states? 

**Datasets: 
1. https://www.kaggle.com/tim27818/homeless-in-america-version-2-20102019?select=dfnohome.csv
2. https://www.kaggle.com/aniruddhasshirahatti/us-unemployment-dataset-2010-2020?select=unemployment_data_us.csv

**### Before You Begin:

1. Create a new repository for this project called `Homelessness-vs-unemployment`.

2. Clone the new repository to your computer.

3. Add your Jupyter notebook and `ipynb` to this folder. These will be the main scripts to run for analysis.

4. Push the above changes to GitHub or GitLab.

**Data Analyst Objective Extraction of data: 

Two different datasets were looked at to perform ETL task items. Homeless in america version 2 csv file and the us unemployment dataset was looked at. Characterisics of unemployment rate, homeless population, age, and gender were taken into account as well. Files were extracted from the referenced sources and loaded into the github repository. 

**Data Analyst Objective Transforming of data: 

Using the datasets for both homelessness and unemployment,both csv files were cleaned to remove "Nan" rows and eliminate incorrect listed states.
